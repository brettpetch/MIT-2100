## News: 
- Syllabus due dates have been ammended. Please refer to [About](/about/) for more info.

Today, we will be hitting on the high points of Chapter 1 & 2 of Mosco and Ch. 1 of Platform Capitalism.

## Smartphone Tracking Industry
I would like to start with the reading from NYT, -- One Nation: Tracked. The topic is how many companies use geo-location signals to identify location of device from which the signals are coming. The point the article is making is that the geo-location of the user has become immensely valueble resource. The data about what facilities, etc. people are using is an absolute goldmine for adverstisers. If they know you are walking down the street and you haven't gone somewhere to eat in X amount of hours, the logic will follow you through many places you may go. IE: Buying clothes, handy tattoo parlour, etc. All of this is considered merely prime commercial information. The draw is that this information from your browsing has deep poltical implications. This means that you may not only be tracked by advertisers, but also by people with other motives. This could be someone with a grudge, etc. or someone who wishes to monitor and find the information of people who have gone to a feminist protest. The information is 'anonymous'; The journalists instead argued that if you know the exact location of a smartphone, travelling from a particular address (let's say my home address), then moves to another location (let's say FIMS) at home, 555 dufferin.... This is a myth about hte anonymity of the geolocational signals. 

Why did I want to start with this type of story? We know that companies provide the operating systems your phones run on, we know that telecoms similarly gather information about smartphone use. Often these apps gather information to transmit this data. The NYT provides the main companies that make this the staple of a buisness, where it is sold to advertisers; or to provide finegrain ad service to a platform. 

I think this issue of surveillance is another very powerful sort of linkage between power and wealth. It identifies the types of issues we will be exploring inside this course. This very clearly illustrates the power in this game. In a very dynamic of what we are going to talk about platform capitalism. If you start to look at this ubiquitous monitoring, you start to wonder...
> "We are living in the world's most advanced surveillance system. This system wasn't created deliberately. It was built throuhg the interplay of technologica advance an profit motive. It was built to make money."
- nyt.

## Two Forces: Capitalism and Technology
To understand how we have gotten to the point we are at today, we must first go back in time (quite a bit). 
- Platform Capitalism / Big Tech.

### Capitalism
We're going to run through this. You may have points of agreement, disagreement, etc. We will have ample time to object to it. We can certainly make space. The word capitalism is discussed alot in the MIT program: the point is that capitalism refers to something very specific. It's not just a boom word. It means something very specific. You need to understand what processes and dynamics it involves. About three or 4 centuries ago in Europe, a market economy emerged, where the whole of life was dependant on the buying and selling of goods. The market started to appear as the central institution by which people organized their lives. A mode of economic and social organization with its epicenter in Europe, soon after the world.

#### Generalized Market Exchange
You can see the connection between GME and Technolgy, prehaps even media technology in particular follow a sequence of propositions that govern life within capitalism people need to sell your capacity to work so you could buy goods (food, clothing, housing, iPhone). These companies compete for profits and have a very very strong incentive to increase the speed and scale of the goods and services they provide. It is heavily based on productivity. This is expedited by new technologies, which includes the horrible smoke emitting factories by which things today, such as cloud computing etc. is utilizing. This idea of generalized market exchange is a fundamental concept. Some of you study economics, etc. 

#### Commodification
If you were to gorw a cannibas plant in your back yard for your own consumption, or knit a sweater for your family it is not considered a commodity. If you were to grow and sell for profit, you would then be creating commodity. A process of commodification where pretty much everything is for sale. The great critic of Capitalism, Karl Marx said that Capitalism was a great heap of commodities. If you were wanting to see something like this, you would go to an Amazon Fulfulment Center where it is supplied and filled by machines to make most efficient use of space. If you want to think about mass commodification look at amazon warehouse.

Surrounding this, the origins of capitalism are taken to note by Smith and Marx.

##### Adam Smith
Smith argued, elequantly that the market is the best form of society because it maximizes individual freedom. It gives people enormous scope, choice, what kind of work they seek out, if they want to be owners, etc.

##### Karl Marx 
Argued that the underlying force is exploitation of workers by owners. He argued that society was divided into two: people who own everything and others who had to sell their capacity to these owners. 

If you feel that you need more backup knowledge please see the supplimentary reading.

#### Economic Growth / Inequality / Climate Crisis
Today, you may notice that there are those that celebrate success in commodity. Critics of capitalism would argue that the steep gap between people... Look at the rocket-like economic growth that capitalism has created. It's not just questions of abstract theory. 

#### Capitalism and the State
Another key concept is to recognize the relationship of capitalism to the state, essentially governments in the powers pocessed by administration and security. You may often hear the proposition that the free market is better than the state; you may realize that the state is a domination of a free market... I am going to say that posed in that very simple way that proposition is rubbish. Capitalism is dependant on laws and regulation: rules and legislations that place constraints on how far corperate interests may go. It may cover issues with personal privacy, private property, etc. is all necessary for a capitalist society to exist. Adding to this, policing also assist surpress resistance to the system. The evolvement of economy is regulation. Sometimes people will talk about deregulation, the state intervention being removed. Instad of thinking of deregulation, you may want to look at as re-regulation by expanding the depth of corperate interests. The role of the state in capitalist econpomies varies according ot time and place. We will be discussing regulation and coperations.

##### By Historical Period
![Final slide]()
Hosted in a historical framework, in fluctuations or changes in the balance between state and corperate power within the main capitalist economy, we must understand this to get to what we call platform captialism. We must look at what happens if everything is going well, we might look at how the state is playing a role. Let the market rise and do what it wants. After a series of massive economic crisis, culminated in the great depression in the 1930's, the rise of fashism and communism on the left, the managers of capitalist society began to think that the state should balance out the state of corperate power. It became Welfare State Capitalism, where it was realized that hte state should prehaps provide unemployment benefits, or healthcare, or organize the media with public sector broadcasting (think of CBC). This is how it dominated 30 years of incredible capitalist growth. In the 1970's this system went into a downturn. The profit rates began to go down; some argued that this was because of buisnesses, etc. The major point here is that in the later part of the 20th century, the rapid rise in prosperity that had seemed to be on the uptick seemed to slow down... Economists became very worried about this. Eventually the great wallstreet crash; the failure of major world markets because of selling improperly subprime mortgages. Banks all over the world started to fail, and governments had to pay for bailouts and consequences of the crisis. To jump very quickly to the chase, it began to turn into what Mosco called Big Tech, wherein they would seekout new kinds of market. This was massively related to new technlogies.

That is a very fast gallop of elementary points of this class.
Let me pause here and ask what you would like me to explain, what you may disagree with, etc. What do you need to know about what was just said.
> Could you please explain Neoliberalism?
- Generally applied as a renewed free market: privatization (removal of sectors of economic activity) giving up the public ownership, funds would be reduced. Privatization, austerity, cutting back wellfare, less provisions of EI, various types of social benefits because they are seen as a 'tax burden' on buisness and doctrines of Free Trade or Globalization. The restrictions of trade between borders should be removed and strong incentives for buisnesses to relocate from where wages are high or restrictions are strict to places that are not so strict. For example, moving production from Europe or NA to Asia, etc. 
    - that is a very important question, that will come up several times in this course.
    - neo-liberalism isn't just the formation of policies, etc. Right at this moment we are in the aftermath of 2008, there is a big question mark in the air as to wether we are past deregulated financial markets. Some people say we are at a place where we are going to see the end of neo-liberalism. Neo-liberalism is one of the terms you will see in that [Supplimentary Document] posted on OWL.
    - Neoliberalism in 2008, in 2007-2008, this was the date of the Wall Street crash, created debate of financial crisis becoming neo-liberalism. If you look at the policies of the Trump Administration, you may notice that they are That is why there is debate about whether we are at the end of neo-liberalism or just it's re-organization. It is also where we start to see the emergance of political figures with very different political figures that are contesting neo-liberal prespectives. You want to figure out wether we are... something new... in the last 34 years. 
> Can you explain why buisnesses...
- That's what i'm going to come to, and is the topic of the next half.

In the second part of the class, I would liek to go through somewhat easier material which I would like to assimilate. Why is it that in looking for ways out of the economic decline of the long downturn, why was that a turn to big tech? how did platform capitalism emerge out of this? While I did speak of the capitalism side of this, I would now like to speak about the tech side. In the first half, I would like to now walk through chapter 1 and 2 of Mosco's book. 

## The Rise of Digital Economy
In particular I am going to talk about five stages in the evolution / development of the internet and digital networks. As many of you may have studied in John Reed's course, and look at the history of the internet: it lies in pentagon war planning and the interest in creating a communication system for missle bases in the case of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. It required an extremely flexible computer networking system. The importance inthe state, which we are talking about. Preforming military functions were layed in the US by the basis of public spending and the military-industrial network. The was the incubator to which the internet came bout in the 1960's.

### The Free Net: 
Students and instructors started to use the internet for other purposes, scientists and students began to talk amongst eachother about virtual games, science fiction, porn, whatever. A largely unauthorized and experimental way. The first Hackers (I am using this term without the negative connocations it has today). Effectively, they jailbroke the internet from the Pentagon where it began. It was starting to be converted to a general network in acedemia and gradually into venues, counter-cultural venues, and specifficaly san-francisco... This may seem extremely strange to you. This was an era when the internet was not at all commerical. At one point, internet was governed as non-commercial. The people working on it genuinely believed that they should create the protocols for the social good and democratization of networks. It enabled the globalization of society, and decentralize control from the government etc. and would be a planet-harmonizing source. If you werent a figure that really embodies this, **Tim Berners Lee** famous for the creation of the World Wide Web, which is not the same as the internet. He created the protocols that allowed for people to connect with eachother. The World Wide Web enabled the use of browsers to harness the power of the internet, navigationally. He came up with the programming that enabled these devleopments. Did he patent it? No. Berners Lee gave it away. He essentially allowed this series of coding practices to be distributed for free. This action was the last but also the greatest development in the free internet.

### The Dot COM Bubble
It was always coming into contact with dot com, the first ebuisness which could be used to make buisness profitable. Mixed in with all this early internet, people started to attempt to find value online, by publishing newspapers and magazines. America Online, carefully curated walled garden access. Search engines, which basically tied themselves closely with advertising, search engine was the mix-in with the advertising function. In the early attempts at creating an e-buisness, it was very uncertain advertising techniques were not well-devleoped and as internet use started to expand, the free internet content frequently didn't accept being asked to pay for things on the internet, nor putting up with ads. People were wanting to access commercial digital sites from silicon valley. They would create flashware, where they would get someone to buy-in, sell out model.
In 2000, there was an enormous stock market crash, where thousands of dot coms were wiped out.

### Web 2.0
There were millions of dollars of investment, where everyhting had gone to waste. The buisness sector begins to look at how they could turn the internet into a profit machine. Web 2.0, which was propositioned by Tim O'Reilley. You can;'t think of it like another publishing venue that just generates content like a news outlet. Because the internet is a larger stage. You must instead look at how users themselves want to generate content. People not only want to write on the internet, they wan't to make multimedia contnet: youtube. You might want to look at how buisnesses, like Online Shops, emergance where platforms would launch their own sorts of activities. Upbeat in content becoming more of a matter of conversation or connection. If you are going to commodify the internet in this kind of way, where is the money going to come from? IF you're goign to make money from this, it's not going to come from selling things over the internet, but instead by using it as an advertising medium by circulating ads ontop of user-generated content as a requirement of participation. As people are participating, launching their own buisnesses, running blogs, etc. they are going to be generating information about themselves. If you are able to extract data about themselves. Habits, income levels, etc. we will have a model of what we'll call "Platform Capitalism". 
This will create a massvie surge in social media and search engine subjectivity. The internet was quickly going global and created massive perceived buisness opporunity to markets like China. 

## Tech and Finance
This was added to by the 2008 Wall Street Crash. This is one of the harder concepts to grasp. There is an important connection between technology and finance. Remember that the US made it easier to borrow money, lowering interest rates after 2000 dot.com bubble burst. It's a classic way of keeping the economy bubbling along even after a big bust. The problem with this in fact is that criminal activity emerged. This lead to the promotion of subprime mortgages. These mortgages were sold to people who could never afford it. It was without credit check, etc. Governmetns all around the world respond with lower interest rates. They lose money, making it addtionally easy to borrow money. Sernerchek argued that investors were willing ot take reisk in order t oget good return of money. Loose tax regulations enabled them to use foreign tax havens, allowing for tech companies to use various tax loopholes. In order to find opportunities that were lucrative in the smoking ruin of the crash, people began turning toward the new tech companies.

### After the Crash
These groups of companies began to emerge using this Web 2.0 Model, like Google, MySpace, Facebook, and Music and Media downloads (iPod). These companies where you see the takeoff point of big tech, platform capitalism. To put these two sides together, we are going to look at the dynamics of the rising digital economy, depth of the long downturn to become a motor to drive a new uptick of economic activity with hopes, and large financial investments to recreate capitalism from what once seemed to be a near-fatal collapse in 2008.

That basically is the beginnings to answer the question of "How did we get here". The hopes, asperations, etc. of how we got here is precisely what we started off with, as the massive power of the corperate missions.

### Questions on this part of the story
> Clarify the reduced tax regulation
- Basic idea in history is that in this period following the financial crash, because of the troubled nature of the economy and the troubled nation, the governments of the world are willing to reduce tax rates on corperations to be really slack instead of actually going after corperations to pay a substantial amount of taxes. In some cases, there are areas of the world whcih will in a certain sense run low to extremely low corperate tax rates, which was particularly advantageous to digitally based companies which could move from county to country. For instance, if General Motors was to claim that they are in the Cayman Isles, they can still see your big factories are in Detroit. If you are an Apple, you can more plausably suggest that your headquarters are in Ireland, as your only thing of value is IP. Google and Apple have both taken advantage of low tax-rates because of the flexability and mobility of digitally based organizatons.

> Following the great financial crash of 2008, was there more or less regulation?
- no there was not more regulation, in a certain sense, there was a doubling down on deregulation of the finance sector. In general, the response was making a more buisness friendly climate to prompt a recovery. Hence, you sas what is generally known as austerity, the reduction of social services which was creating a tax burden on the corperate tax economy. 

> Could State regulation, when there is a crash could it do the opposite?
- This would be the counter arguement from a new-left socialist ties. This is the point at which we should see large government programs of expendenture, raised minimum levels of pay, make and provide national health services. Make large scale government funded plans to create jobs and lift economic activity out of where is was because of the crash. Excellent question.

We will come back to this when we come back to different models which have been created instead of the boosting of corperations. Instead, give people completely free broadband internet services. 

> Are you talking about a whole world or just a singular country in these cases.
- the main location of the great crash and the reprocussions following it originated in EU and NA, but the picture from this painted a picture quite differently. In china, there is a huge discussion at the moment as to how we should understand the economy -- as a state lead capitalist regime or... Later, I would like to speak of the direction the digital economy has taken in China. It now is about rivals and how it contends with the United States and how it is a now very combaitive and competitive... It's a spot on question.

Thanks for your attention, see you next week
