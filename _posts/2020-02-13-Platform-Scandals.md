# Today
Today marks the middle of the semester. It also marks a shift in the material we are going to deal with in this course. We have been looking at the basic models of platform capitalism and how it's influential in our everyday lives, especially as you wrote in your essay about your involvement in Platform Capitalism. We are going to look at the problems Platform Capitalism creates. This is where we really do see the rubber hitting the road. It involves questions. Today, We're going to do 4 things, first by taking about the Cambridge Analytical Scandal. Towards the end, I will do some preperation for the midterm exam, of course you will be taking it the thursday immediately after the reading week. However far we get, I am going to break off at quarter-to-four. I also have to disappear to FNB to do an introduction.

# The Cambridge Analytica Scandal
This scandal was central in the elections of 2016, that was nearly 4 years ago. I think it's important to know what happened around Cambridge Analytica, and how people have shifted from an accepting stance to a more critical one. The Cambridge Analytica consulting firm was involved in a massive breach of privacy on facebook users. They created precision targeted advertisements in interests of Donald Trump. There is a powerful argument that these events created an important landmark in highly manipulative and secretive events around the US election. We have only gradually learned about what happened here, because someone involved in Cambridge Analytica became a whistle blower in 2018 galvanizing public awareness. Wylie wrote a book called "Mindf*ck". If you were to read one book this semester or over the summer on media, I would recommend it. It's a truly mind-blowing book. 

You may have, aside from this course heard of Camebridge Analytica. There is a Netflix documentary, [The Great Hack](https://youtu.be/iX8GxLP1FHo).

That was the facebook version way. I am going to break this down in a more, no pun intended "analytic" mode. There are still things that are quite opaque, things we don't exactly know. If there is at any point something you'd like to contest, please stick up your hand.

It's a complicated story to tell properly. It has several components, faces and companies. It had involvement from Facebook, Psychometrics Centre, a Strategic Communications Lab, of which Cambridge Analytica is a spin off, the US Trump campaign, whistle blower christopher Wylie, and Russian State Hackers

## Facebook
Facebook is **the platform capitalist** at the root of this story, I shouldn't need to explain to you what it is, also for the class on Jan 30th, you read an article called "The Facebook Decade". I'd refer you back to it if you were going to look at it. Facebook is the leading social media site as an advertising driven platform capitalist. Between the two, Google and Facebook serve 75-80% of advertisements on the internet. Because these companies are free, they are able to match you with advertisements to target advertisements towards people, and to that end, Facebook has created a prodigious advertisement platform. IT tracks the pages you like, ads you click, your device and location settings. They build up a large dataset that is highly lucrative to advertisers. Facebook could provide 98 data points of every Facebook User. See slides. This is adequate to provide you with the amount of data troves Facebook has on its users. As well as Facebook amassing data for its own services, it also allowed other agents to conduct research on Facebook users, welcomed even. One of these institutions was known as ... It would compare the facebook data to personality types, their character, temperament, attitude, etc. on Facebook. Someone from the psychometric institute.

<iframe style="height: 45vh; width: 55vh;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xGsb9MSFgQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So, they have a spokesperson from this institute that admits the research and the privacy. There is a term for this opt-out, which is called
> bullshit.

One of his associates, Cogen paid a bunch (several thousand) users to take an online personality test. Their attraction was a psychometric profile provided to them. This was quite attractive. It was designed to measure state of the art personality testing that suggests there are 5 big traits or characteristics that define personality type. Openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. It builds up a fairly comprehensive and reliable portrait of what kind of a person you are and what might be your political views...

When people used this app, the app pulled all of their Facebook Data. It took all their likes, preferences, alongside their personality type. It also pulled all the information on the Facebook Profiles on their entire network of friends. This was specified in the terms of use of the app, but was in such small print form that no one likely realized what was going on. The average Facebook user has between 100-150 friends. Suppose you get 10,000 people, then get information with 150x the people. Once there was a correlation found between social indicators and their backgrounds, you could deduce from the Facebook Data what the psychological profile of a user would be; they already made a correlation in this data. When you put these two things together, you have a very very deep portrait a person.

What the Psychometric Institute was interested in was creating better advertising tools. They may have been thinking about advertising commodity, but there are other kinds of advertising. Strategic Communication Labs, it is an information warfare company. What it did was it worked partially for the British Military and on contract for various governments that used digital data to composite a profile to influence their political decisions. One of the things they did was identifying likely terrorist subjects from online information. On this basic data they would be interested in, relating to economic information and linking it to certain personality types to what would be an activist or terrorist profile. Other sort of thing that Strategic Communication Labs did things that were rather dubious. They received requests to sway elections. There was some "funny business", but some very serious business and data manipulation going on. 

In 2015, Nix sprung off SC to Cambridge Analytica. Trump paid 20 million dollars to Strategic Communications Lab to use their expertise to create a company which would essentially use Strategic Communications... It was basically american to protect what was going on from the taint of Foreign interference.

These people were Steve Bannon, the Trump Strategist and head of Breitbart News. It was strategically situated at a whole web of internet circulative sites, the alt-right.  The money came from Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah. They both had strong right-wing views. So what you basically had at this point, take a look at the slide at our own leisure, was a Strategic Communication Lab had already purchased the ability to match sociological profiles with Facebook data. It would create an extremely detailed and accurate view on important items for Americans 87 million americans of which they established these profiles. 

Tl;Dr: This kind of person has the personality type to be a trump voter, however we can see that they didn't vote in the last 2 elections. If we were to stir up their strongest emotions using issues that are highly contested in the states, issues about gun ownership, migration, clinton conspiracies, etc. If we then after targeting them for some time of provocative messages, start sending messages to vote for Trump, we will be able to mobilize them. According to Wylie, Camebridge Analytica made a special attempt to find people with unstable or vulnerable personalities. They felt that they could zap with these types of people. That is the basic persuasion apparatus that were built up on behalf of the trump campaign. It was all done without people knowing this data was being done to them. They had no idea that they were being based on the profiles... We know about this because in 2018, one of the senior data-scientists for Camebridge Analytica suffered pain of concious of what his company had done. A journalist, Carole Cadwallader convinced him to come out and he became a whistle blower.

I encourage you to read Wylie's book. 

## Russian Election Interference
There was also a serious attempt by proxies of the Russian Government to influence the outcome of the election to prevent clinton from coming into power. These are some of the memes and messages that were circulated by russian agents. The major social media platforms conducted their own autopsies, it seems to have been sizable (see stats on slide). There's also a video here on Russian "Election Hacking" in 2016. I'm going to jump over that. Most scholars would likely say that it was a sizable impact.

## The Fallout
There were fears in europe, especially around things like Brexit, where hearings were held, got wylie and others to speak. Facebook was fined $5 billion for deceiving users about their privacy policy. There is extensive disagreement about how much the russian hacking, etc. contributed to Trump's campaign. there was no reprecussion. 

This was a major scandal for Platform Capitalism at the most obvious level. Raised the question about how tight privacy policies were, and how they were monitoring content. This brought to attention the whole user-generated content and data extraction buisness model in question. Raises the question about the levels of corperate responsibilty. 2016 began the start of Techlash, at which the excited exunberance of connecting people, it brought forward some darker considerations, like breaking up these big tech corperations. Maybe there should be higher levels of regulation, etc. Maybe we want to move these platforms as utilties rather than something without public oversight. Those are the sort of questions that start to come up. We will look at the gender relations, the labour relations, environmental objections, etc. on what platform capitalism means before the cambridge analytica scandal.

# Exam
I'm going to brief you on the midterm:
Thursday: week after reading week, we will dedicate the entire class to the midterm exam. It will be from 2:30-4:10pm. It is a closed-book exam, short answer questions and you will need to do 5/7. Each of these will ask to provide a defintion, examples and some kind of background of the concept. There are going to be no trick questions and no curve balls on this exam. These will be from substantial sections of the course texts have been devoted, or short article readings have been devoted which I have lectured on at some legnth. The sort of term I'm thinking of is "the long downturn", which was a Nick Snerck. Maybe I gave a lecture on free major technologies on data analytics, cloud computing etc. Maybe I'll ask you about Camebridge Analytica... These things are not subtle. You need to look at what are the big ideas or major themes. You also need to provide a consise defintion, fill out with some examples that might illustrate it, when the idea came up, out of what setting, etc. etc. You should be able to answer each of these in 2 paragraphs. One for definition, the other for context and providing some examples. Go for the big themes, the big ideas, the lecture notes, and look at some things of what i lectured on for an entire slide to an entire lecutre. Revise in that way.

 think the rest is pretty self-explanitory. 

 Any questions about the exam? Quotes are not required. Unless it's something really piffy and brilliant that someone said. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product is a nice little throwaway line. If you have a photographic memory, go for it, but it's really not required.

 You don't need to remember ALL OF THE numbers, however they are qustion.

 Nick Snercheck identifies 5 type of platform capitalism: he says between Google and Facebook have 75% of advertising... Most of the concern is that you have the big ideas. Usually there are some standouts and statistics.

 Anymore on this?

 OK. CHEERS. 

 Ok, so your tutorial assistants told me that you folks were somewhat unclear on the relation between neo-liberalism and financial crisis and emergene of platform capitalism

 Let me take a quick run at trying to explain it differently.

 What we're concerned with here is the question of where did neo-liberalism emerge from and what is the relation ot Platform Capitalism to it?

 the classic definition of neoliberalism is a... decline of profitability in US and European buisness. Less taxation, wellfare were too demanding. Some figures: Thatcher, Reagan, etc. The sort of policies of neo-liberalism or de-regulation of economy (cutting red tape) or alternatively described as giving greater power to the private sector. Privatization of all of the things. IE: CBC would be deminished, freeing up possibilities of privitization. Free trade (globalization), enables seeking out of low-wage / low-cost locations to up production. Neoliberalism proved to be rather unstable in the financial system. The government reduced its oversight in the financial sector, refused to restict trades taking place. There were 2 major crashes in 2000 (dot.com crash) and the 2nd in 2008, where there was a Wall Street crash based in subprime mortgages. Basically, there was financial calamity, the government bailed out banks from financial disaster and started to reduce public expendature. This kind of instability lies deep in the background to the election of Trump in 2016, and there is question. Trump is back into nationalist economics. In terms of the internal policy, he lets the market do its thing.

 Why is this important to Platform Capitalism?
 These economic failures showed real weakness in their economy. Wall Street had blow it, the housing market was shattered, the auto industry was in recession due to automation or offshoring of jobs, platform capitalists were the only promising game in town. It seemed to be a free area to be marketed... benefits from low interest rates and lax tax regulation

A new "White Knight" out of the 2008 crash. I've got to go. Hand in your essay. thx.
