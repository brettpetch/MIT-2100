# Today
Today marks the middle of the semester. It also marks a shift in the material we are going to deal with in this course. We have been looking at the basic models of platform capitalism and how it's influential in our everyday lives, especially as you wrote in your essay about your involvement in Platform Capitalism. We are going to look at the problems Platform Capitalism creates. This is where we really do see the rubber hitting the road. It involves questions. Today, We're going to do 4 things, first by taking about the Cambridge Analytical Scandal. Towards the end, I will do some preperation for the midterm exam, of course you will be taking it the thursday immediately after the reading week. However far we get, I am going to break off at quarter-to-four. I also have to disappear to FNB to do an introduction.

# The Cambridge Analytica Scandal
This scandal was central in the elections of 2016, that was nearly 4 years ago. I think it's important to know what happened around Cambridge Analytica, and how people have shifted from an accepting stance to a more critical one. The Cambridge Analytica consulting firm was involved in a massive breach of privacy on facebook users. They created precision targeted advertisments in interests of Donald Trump. There is a powerful argument that these events created an important landmark in highly manipultive and secretive events around the US election. We have only gradually learned about what happened here, because someone involved in Cambridge Analytica became a whistleblower in 2018 galvonizing public awareness. Wylie wrote a book called "Mindf*ck". If you were to read one book this semester or over the summer on media, I would reccomend it. It's a truly mindblowing book. 

You may have, aside from this course heard of Camebridge Analytica. There is a Netflix documentary, [The Great Hack](https://youtu.be/iX8GxLP1FHo).

That was the facebook version way. I am going to break this down in a more, no pun intended "analytic" mode. There are still things that are quite opaque, things we don't exactly know. If there is at any point something you'd like to contest, please stick up your hand.

It's a complicated story to tell properly. It has several compontents, faces and companies. It had involvemnt from Facebook, Psychometrics Centre, a Strategic Communications Lab, of which Cambridge Analytica is a spin off, the US Trump campaign, whistleblower christopher Wylie, and Russian State Hackers

## Facebook
Facebook is **the platform capitalist** at the root of this story, I shouldn't need to explain to you what it is, also for the class on Jan 30th, you read an article called "The Facebook Decade". I'd refer you back to it if you were going to look at it. Facebook is the leading social media site as an advertising driven platform capitalist. Between the two, Google and Facebook serve 75-80% of advertisements on the internet. Because these companies are free, they are able to match you with advertisements to target advertisements towards people, and to that end, Facebook has created a prodigious advertisement platform. IT tracks the pages you like, ads you click, your device and location settings. They build up a large dataset that is highly lucrative to advertisers. Facebook could provide 98 datapoints of every Facebook User. See slides. This is adequate to provide you with the amount of data troves Facebook has on its users. As well as Facebook amassing data for its own services, it also allowed other agents to conduct research on Facebook users, welcomed even. One of these institutions was known as ... It would compare the facebook data to personality types, their character, temperment, attitute, etc. on Facebook. Someone from the psychometric institute.

So, they have a spokesperson from this institute that admits the research and the privacy. There is a term for this opt-out, which is called
> bullshit.

One of his associates, Cogen paid a bunch (several thousand) users to take an online personality test. Their attraction was a psycometric profile provided to them. This was quite attractive. It was designed to measure state of the art personality testing that suggests there are 5 big traits or characteristics that define personality type. Openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. It builds up a fairly comprehensive and reliable portrait of what kind of a person you are and what might be your political views...

When people used this app, the app pulled all of their Facebook Data. It took all their likes, preferences, alongside their personality type. It also pulled all the information on the Facebook Profiles on their entire network of friends. This was specified in the terms of use of the app, but was in such small print form that no one likely realized what was going on. The average Facebook user has between 100-150 friends. Suppose you get 10,000 people, then get information with 150x the people. Once there was a correlation found between social indicators and their backgrounds, you could deduce from the Facebook Data what the psycological profile of a user would be; they already made a correlation in this data. When you put these two things together, you have a very very deep portrait a person.

What the Psychometric Insitute was interested in was creating better advertising tools. They may have been thinking about advertising commodity, but there are other kinds of advertising. Strategic Communication Labs, it is an information warfare company. What it did was it worked partially for the British Miltiary and on contract for various governments that used digital data to composite a profile to influence their poltical decisions. One of the things they did was identifying likely terrorist subjects from online information. On this basic data they would be interested in, relating to economic information and linking it to certain personality types to what would be an activist or terrorist profile. Other sort of thing that Strategic Communication Labs did things that were rather dubious. They received requests to sway elections. There was some "funny business", but some very serious buisness and data manipulation going on. 

In 2015, Nix sprung off SC to Cambridge Analytica. Trump paid 20 million dollars to Strategic Communications Lab to use their expertise to create a company which would essentially use Strategic Communications... It was basically american to protect what was going on from the taint of Foreign interference.

These people were Steve Bannon, the Trump Strategist and head of Breitbart News. It was strategically situated at a whole web of internet circulative sites, the alt-right.  The money came from Rober Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah. They both had strong right-wing views. So what you basically had at this point, take a look at the slide at our own leisure, was a Strategic Communication Lab had already purchased the ability to match sociological profiles with Facebook data. It would create an extremely detailed and accurate view on important items for Americans 87 million americans of which they established these profiles. 

Tl;Dr: This kind of person has the personality type to be a trump voter, however we can see that they didn't vote in the last 2 elections. If we were to stir up their strongest emotions using issues that are highly contested in the states, issues about gun ownership, migration, clinton conspiracies, etc. If we then after targeting them for some time of provocative messages, start sending messages to vote for Trump, we will be able to mobilize them. According to Wylie, Camebridge analytica made a special attempt to find people with unstable or vulnerable personalities. They felt that they could zap with these types of people. That is the basic pursuasion apperatus that were built up on behalf of the trump campaign. It was all done without people knowing this data was being done to them. They had no idea that they were being based on the profiles... We know about this because in 2018, one of the senior data-scientists for Camebridge Analytica suffered pain of concious of what his company had done. A journalist, Carole Cadwallader convinced him to come out and he became a whistleblower.
