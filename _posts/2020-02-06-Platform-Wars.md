# Lecture
In this lecture, I want to establish 2 things, primarily a reading guide for *Platform Wars* and in the second part, I'd like to talk about the extensions of Platform Wars, as well as China in Platform Capitalism. Again, I'd like to emphasize that if you do not understand, please don't hesitate to raise your hand, ask a question and make a point. 

Right off the top, is there anyone with immediate questions that we can get out of the way?

Alright, Let's go then.

# Political Economy 101
I'd like to start with very basic concepts of Political Economy. These concepts, which are applicable to the study of almost anything from the politcal economical perspective. You can apply these examples ot oil industry, retail, the film industry, the film industry or the media industry. They have much wider applications t
- Concentration of Ownership
- Competition
- Monopoly
- Oilopoly

The biggest issue here is concentration of ownership, which pertains to a specific sector of an industry. Is it many companies involved, or perhaps only one? If we talk about a field that's characterized by competition, we have the idea that there are many different capitalist players trying ot make sales and gain profits. At the other end of CoO, there can be only one company dominating the entire field. You can look at this in North America in the early 20th century in the oil industry. This could be only one grocery retailer, or one movie maker. Situations of pure monopoly are relatively rare. There is also Oligopoly, where there is a handful of companies dominating the field. This is the idea of concentration of ownership. 

But why should we care? Why might we care about why an area of activity of industry is monooplistic. 
- It could mean that our positions are being shaped by a few key players
You've hit on the key point, if there is only one key player, it could be shaping the realities that are made up. What are other issues of one company owning everything? 
- Lack of incentive to improve upon a product. 
absolutely, yes. Lack of competition is removing the incentive of wanting to do better than someone you're trying to beat at the game. 
- They can also set the price
BINGO! there we go. In a certain sense, they are in a position to dictate the price to the public (because no one can undercut them). In the eyes of many economists, who like the idea of a free economy don't 

Extreme condemnation in tendencies of monopolization. Many critics, such as Karl Marx see this a big capitalist starting to swallow up all of it's competitors. Have quite often favoured, or stripped the monopoly powers. It is essential for you to understand: Innovation, Information and Price Fixing.

If you look at this chart of the depiction of the big 5 tech corporations, you can see a number of things. The first is that there are FIVE of them. This is about the number you need to characterize it as an oligopolistic. In each of thee companies, you generally see (in the revenue) that they have one characteristic domain in which they are very strong. In Alphabet, In Apple, In Facebook and Amazon they all have certain domains where their strength is concentrated, but they also have fingers in other fields. 

Currently, you're writing an essay on where you fit-in, these guides of where they are getting their money from should assist in thinking through their issue. If we got to this web page, here you will find an excellent info-graphic on how they generate revenue, much more relevant (2018) and some very useful thoughts about the position of you, if you are a customer of these companies in how they are extracting revenue from your activity. If you're working frantically toward handing in your essay next week, I'd recommend reading this or other pages on the web regarding this type of issue. 

# Oligopolistic Tendancies

To go more deeply in the oligopolistic tendencies of these companies, although they don't dominate any given field have a very strong oligopolistic domination. You can immediately see that these companies have a premiere position in certain fields. But also, we see that they engage in competition. This image from The Economist (game of thrones reference). Just like ancient feudal baronies, although they have their own strongholds, they are at war for each other. This is a situation that is characterized as Oligopolistic Competition. They're fighting it out over certain areas of shared business. This state of platform oligopolism are "Platform Wars", business wars if you'd like between these competitors. The importance to data, the tendencies between convergence (different platform companies encroaching on the same market and data areas), and the idea of the silo, within their own domains on their particular platforms. Let me just pause here, and ensure we're clear so far. Anything? no. 

Ok, so the first point Srnicek raises as critical in these platforms is the data about their customers. Information about you and me is the new oil. You might have wondered about why on earth I'd have a giant oil platform on the screen, people say today that data is the new oil. In the industrial era, Oil was considered to be absolutely critical to run the car engines, and likewise, the same is with data for these platforms. It's not like data has abolished oil, but you get the idea. As you would have heard Srnicek say in his lecture last week, you may think of the big advertising companies depending on information about customers to sell highly targeted advertising opportunities. The really critical thing is for them to get these data points from you: your purchasing patterns, your age, gender, race, postal code, etc. They're even willing to provide free services to extract this information to you and me. You may think of Google Search and Google Maps as just one kind of "Freebie", a public facility that we access at no cost whatsoever. It may look this way, but as Srnicek said, it's like a new territory to be colonized. 

## Network Effects
It's constantly in the interests of these companies to get more information on how we use these services. So forth, and so on. And you'll remember that the critical idea Srnicek unfolds is "Network Effects", to put it simply, the more you use a network, the more others will want to join. Simply, one telephone in the world is useless, if there is 1 telephone, then there is no use, but if there are 2 or 3, Metcalfe's law says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected to the system (n2). Since networks are the means by which many platform capitalists extract information from users, there is a very strong incentive to expand these networks, or give them away for free. This is first mover advantage. The idea of rapid expansion on a network. The more people on a network, the more it's worth. 

The other thing you have to think about to this importance of data, which is a saying that is quite known.
> "If you're not paying to the product, then you are the product being sold"

If you are receiving a free service, in a media environment it is almost certainly because the platform is going to either use or sell information for advertising purpose. All of the information about you is being put into use by the company selling that product. Some platform companies do sell commodities to you, but a lot gather information to sell to ad companies.

## Convergence
The second term Srnicek references is Convergence. An entry in the same domains which is also competitive. This could be considered to be "Fighting it out" over contested territory. Platforms start from a "core business segment", but then start ot expand across other areas of business, where they can cull and gather information and it starts to bring them into competition with each other. They step out of their area, and will contest an area where another oligopolistic tendencies are emerging. Google (android) v. Apple (iPhone), have taken over the operating system that runs on your phone, moving to virtual assistants and increasingly wanting people to buy IoT devices, like the nest, echo and home automation hubs. The contest over crowd computing services to the US government (reading from this week), we discussed the centrality of AWS, using their resources and renting them out to other digital media companies, where they have continued to grow. There are also other platform capitalist companies that are also interested in this are Google and Microsoft. One of the biggest of these is selling to the Pentagon. It reminds us, again the importance of the state in contemporary platform capitalism. You may remember the military origins of the internet, ARPANET originally grew out of experiments by the US government which was going to function in extreme conditions, eliminating fixed command posts to be taken out. 

Many people who write about the internet write as if once Academics and Culturalists got ahold of the internet they broke it free of the military and turned it into this cultural place for leisure. All around the world, as the digital revolution expanded, more and more military operations are dependant on these technology. In past years, cyber war, etc. have become relevant. This recent clash or context between Amazon and Microsoft over who will get the contract for the Pentagon's "WarCloud", as the JEDI Project, it reminds us that the state and the military security aspects of the states continue to be big customers and work hand in glove with corporations. Increasingly, we have a military digital complex. Just to remind you of the article (video from article). 

So, that example, I think is really telling about what the nature of oligopolistic tendencies are, but this is not competition between mom & dad sized digital companies, or multiplicity of small but nimble silicon valley start ups, but rather behemoths, which have lied claim to being the riches person in the world with the largest array of digital resources. Mammoths of digital war fighting abilities for the US Government. 

## Silos
Just for those of you who may or may not be familiar with something like this, it's a free standing, self-contained tower for grain silos, for hosting agricultural things like corn. Under the domination of Platform Capitalism is that oligopolistic tendencies will focus all of their tendencies into the digital world. One example would be Google, who makes people use their maps, search all in one place. Facebook would be another example, using Facebook friends, news feed, WhatsApp with messages. Amazon even, who we think of an online retail company, but they know where you go for Streaming Television. Now with prime you get your entertainment services. You may also see Amazon's Twitch for much of your gaming experience. The creation of these "everything environments", the contest is being fought out for doing everything on a Google, or a Facebook, or an Amazon operating system to be sealed completely within the environment of that company. 

So those are the tendencies of what Srnick... 

Any points of clarification before we break?

Clarify Self-Driving Cars: Uber, Apple, Amazon
So as you've probably heard, with recent advances in Machine Learning, there have been increasing interest in Autonomous vehicles, which would drive themselves. The interesting thing about this is while some of the players in this field, be it traditional auto makers, because the key component is the Artificial intelligence, an information system, we see appearing in this field a number of big platform capitalist companies. For example. Google started it's own Self-Driving car subsidiary, Wemo, which depends very much on it's ability to rapidly process huge amounts of visual and navigational information. Some of these systems may be zapped over high-speed networks, others may happen on board.

Others, such as Uber, that is a lean company, has screens and screens and screens about what it's actually like to operate vehicles. It's pouring all of this into it's car-driving artificial intelligence. IT's why we see both the 'Classic' automobile companies, as well as newer platform capitalists

Explain Network Effect and Data, Platform Wars?
Let's go back here: so if data is the new oil, the key resource, and the way you get data is from a network with a very large number of users, then you want to expand the size of your networks as quickly as possible. Why? because there is a self-propelling or self-reinforcing dynamic at work. If there are people using a network, then a lot of people will want to use it. Because everyone is on Facebook, If you want to keep in touch with friends, you go to facebook. If you want a very good search engine, you go to Google because it collects data based on other searchers. The more popular a network, the larger it will become. You pool resources into getting users, even if that means initial loss. In the long run, if you get this network effect, if you are the go-to place for social media contacts, or snappy fast conversation with a bunch of interesting people, you go to Twitter, that's where you go. If you want professional contacts, you go to LinkedIn. The idea is that you want to get them quickly.

# China
I'd like to touch about some of the international dimensions of Platform Capitalism. I think it's really important for us to remember that the advent of Platform Capitalism isn't only happening in a North American context, but also at an truly International Level. In one of the chapters by Mosco, as coined in America is the **China Challenge**, which is also seen in at least some context in the west. I'd also like to indicate some of the issues that are not only confined to North American, but also how external forces are having play here at home. For those of you, if anyone is familiar with China, if you think there are mistakes or inflections that need to be added, do not hesitate to speak up. In this area, I'm subject to error as well. 

We are dealing here with an issue that is increasingly framed as an issue of economic issue in North America, or as a political economic rivalry. It is important to understand some of the history of this. If I'd been teaching this course 10 years ago, I'd likely talked about china as the site to which many US and EU companies sent electronics assembly work. The classic image of China's role in the digital evolution of the world. There were large large electronics factories, employing 10,000 + people, but not programming the architecture, etc. instead building the device; putting the chips in, assembly. This was realized as cheap labour as routinised, etc. that Americans may lament their jobs going to china, but many jobs that were not wanted to be done. If I was talking about this 10 years ago, I'd talk about companies like Foxconn, where in 2010, or 2011 there were largely disciplined low paying conditions that lead to protest-suicides, leading to young people to jumping off the room. This was brought to attention that this is the conditions by which your iPhone is being produced. There are many radio reports, NGOs that regularly report on what can be fairly considered Labour abuses. University students compelled to work, use of child labour, etc. etc.  I do not in any way want to say these horizons have disappeared in China. I'd instead like to look at some really remarkable changes in the domestic forms of Platform Capitalism. 

China has a rapidly expanding economy, with a high population and high levels of internet access and smart phone use. In China, because of the importance of the Communist party, some aspects which have been marketized and turned into a capitalist economy. The US has thrown large amounts of money into it's digitally advanced companies.

```Anything?```

## Surveillance, Firewalls

So, the other aspect of this is, again another aspect that has some difference, but similarities to the north american context, is the issue of China. In china, this has been a particularly important issue with the explicit role of the chinese internet and what is accessed by the population on the internet. Many of you have likely heard the phrase "the great firewall of china", which relates to the monitoring, censoring, and blocking of sites dealing with volatile political issues or considered anti-social by the government. Issues of this may include things such as the events in the PMM uprising, the rebellions and revolts against the Chinese government. I don't know what the coverage of the Hong Kong issue is, but they are frequently blocked out by the chinese government. ISPs are required to uphold these censorships. In addition to this, china probably has one of the strongest systems of digital state surveillance, the extensive use of Facial Recognition technologies, behaviours, pedestrian traffic violations. One of you sent me a pretty fascinating video about its application, and i encourage you to take a look at this. This kind of internet regulation is contested heavily by human rights issues. 

<iframe style="width: 55vw; height: 45vh;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CLo3e1Pak-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

, in 2011, when Edward Snowden exposed the amount of surveillance being done in the North American market. Even if we just bracket for a moment the whole argument of the degrees of human rights violations being conducted by different types of governments, there is an economic issue with this issue. Because many of the Western world digital corporations refuse to conform to Chinese government. However, many american companies help facilitate the "Great Firewall of China", which has lead to the exclusion of Western companies, a protected environment for it's own tech companies.

Anything?

## Alternative Media Environments
Ok, so, within this huge national envornment, there have now appeared a number of platform capitalist enterprises that resemble their western counterparts, and have remarkable features of their own. Some of the companies involved are Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, Xiaomi and Huawei, which have been in the news recently. 

<iframe style="width: 55vw; height: 45vh;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ByU3cYz6FvE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So, I have here a couple of URLs to provide a bit of a picture of companies we have already mentioned, I won't play these now, but these are worthwhile to look at, specifically TenCent, WeChat, etc. This single app has almost everything you'd need. It nearly laps over both the desktop and laptop. 

<iframe style="width: 55vw; height: 45vh;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m5yFhJFqw5w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Has gone from the place of manual cheap labour jobs where tech companies from America were attempting to do so, and the picture has really changed. Increasingly in concern about digital platforms competing in North America, completely reversing the previous picture. Huawei has been increasingly in the news because of this. I wouldn't consider Huawei to be a platform capitalist, but they are interested in platform capitalism. They are a manufacturer for handsets and networking equipment. Huawei does not make it's own OS for phones, etc. In some ways, Huawei is more about the equipment and hardware on which platforms are to depend. Where huawei has really stood out is its leadership in what are called 5G Networks to be rolled out. They are advances in network speed and efficiency that will massively expedite the communication speed for gaming, or for getting information from all kinds of sources, or using efficient networks to operate autonomous vehicles, advanced robotics, etc. Huawei is teh world leader in this. They already supply a remarkable number, particularly in asia, but to some degree in the EU and Africa. This issue of Huawei's leading role of supplying telecommunications equipment has become a complex issue in the US, which has incited trade wars, on the part of US high tech companies that they are being outdone in terms of being the vendors in everything that is required for advances in digital networks. At the same time, the US Government has raised the issue of Server Espionage, which has been a long standing beef of the companies. The US has claimed that it would be a threat to US national security, and its allies were used in the construction of new networks. The network could have secret technological back doors or access points that could be used to extract data about military activities. This has also delayed the adoption of 5G technologies. This also introduced the idea, in 2018 where the US banned apps from equipment created in China. 

In accusing it's own back doors, the reason it knows about these techniques is because the NSA tried to do this to china years ago. This was revealed in Edward Snowden's revelation in 2011. On the one hand, you have one American US lead expansion in network technologies would suggest it's malicious designs to NA security, and Huawei and china itself is saying it's the best manufacturer for the job. Now, as you're probably all very aware, this issue landed on Canada's doorstep with the arrest of the CFO of Huawei. She was arrested in Vancouver on an Extradition order to the US, She is now on house arrest, as there hasn't been a extradition verdict in Canada. 

In retaliation, China has arrested several Canadians suspecting espionage. Here is a short explanation of this:

Ok, so there could be alot more said about this huawei concern, although we can start to see from this development in Platform Capitalism were raising very very high indeed, but not only the rival of oligopolistic tendencies...

Next week, we're going to look at platform capitalism and look at some of these new types of political conflicts as well as the international arena as well as internal issues. That is the sort of terrain we are going to start moving into in the 2nd half of the course in the 2nd half of the course after reading week. 

Next week, I'm going to give an introduction to what platform scandals are, and I'm also going to do a quick revision session on where I could have clarified myself in lecture and I'll also say a bit about the midterm. Also, ensure you bring your Platform Capitalism Assignment.
