# Lecture
In this lecture, I want to establish 2 things, primarily a reading guide for *Platform Wars* and in the second part, I'd like to talk about the extensions of Platform Wars, as well as China in Platform Capitalism. Again, I'd like to emphasize that if you do not understand, please don't hesitate to raise your hand, ask a question and make a point. 

Right off the top, is there anyone with immediate questions that we can get out of the way?

Alright, Let's go then.

# Political Economy 101
I'd like to start with very basic concepts of Political Economy. These concepts, which are applicable to the study of almost anything from the politcal economical perspective. You can apply these examples ot oil industry, retail, the film industry, the film industry or the media industry. They have much wider applications t
- Concentration of Ownership
- Competition
- Monopoly
- Oilopoly

The biggest issue here is concentration of ownership, which pertains to a specific sector of an industry. Is it many companies involved, or prehaps only one? If we talk about a field that's characterized by competition, we have the idea that there are many different capitalist players trying ot make sales and gain profits. At the other end of CoO, there can be only one company dominating the entire field. You can look at this in North America in the early 20th century in the oil industry. This could be only one grocery retailer, or one movie maker. Situations of pure monopoly are relatively rare. There is also Oligopoly, where there is a handful of companies dominating the field. This is the idea of concentration of ownership. 

But why should we care? Why might we care about why an area of activity of industry is monopoplistic. 
- It could mean that our positions are being shaped by a few key players
You've hit on the key point, if there is only one key player, it could be shaping the realities that are made up. What are other issues of one company owning everything? 
- Lack of incentive to improve upon a product. 
absolutely, yes. Lack of competition is removing the incentive of wanting to do better than someone you're trying to beat at the game. 
- They can also set the price
BINGO! there we go. In a certain sense, they are in a position to dictate the price to the public (because no one can undercut them). In the eyes of many economists, who like the idea of a free economy don't 

Extreme condemnation in tendancies of monopolization. Many critics, such as Karl Marx see this a big capitalist starting to swallow up all of it's competitors. Have quite often favoured, or stripped the monopoly powers. It is essential for you to understand: Innovation, Information and Price Fixing.

If you look at this chart of the depiction of the big 5 tech corperations, you can see a number of things. The first is that there are FIVE of them. This is about the number you need to characterize it as an OILOPOLISTIC. In eacho f thee companies, you generally see (in the revenue) that they have one characteristic domain in which they are very strong. In Alphabet, In Apple, In Facebook and Amazon they all have certain domains where their stregnth is concentrated, but they also have fingers in other fields. 

Currently, you're writing an essay on where you fit-in, these guides of where they are getting their money from should assist in thinking through their issue. If we got to this webpage, here you will find an excellent infographic on how they generate revenue, much more relevant (2018) and some very useful thoughts about the position of you, if you are a customer of these companies in how they are extracting revenue from your activity. If you're working frantically toward handing in your essay next week, I'd reccomend reading this or other pages on the web regarding this type of issue. 

To go more deeply in the oligopolistic tendancies of these companies, although they don't dominate any given field have a very strong oligopolistic domination. You can immediately see that these companies have a premiere position in certain fields. But also, we see that they engage in competition. This image from The Economist (game of thrones reference). Just like ancient feudal baronies, although they have their own strongholds, they are at war for eachother. This is a situation that is characterized as Oligopolistic Competiton. They're fighting it out over certain areas of shared buisness. This state of platform oligopolistism are "Platform Wars", buisness wars if you'd like between these competitors. The importance to data, the tendancies between convergence (different platform companies encroaching on the same market and data areas), and the idea of the silo, within their own domains on their particular platforms. Let me just pause here, and ensure we're clear so far. Anything? no. 

Ok, so the first point Srnicek raises as critical in these platforms is the data about their customers. Information about you and me is the new oil. You might have wondered about why on earth I'd have a giant oil platform on the screen, people say today that data is the new oil. In the industrial era, Oil was considered to be absolutely critical to run the car engines, and likewise, the same is with data for these platforms. It's not like data has abolished oil, but you get the idea. As you would have heard Srnicek say in his lecture last week, you may think of the big advertising companies depending on information about customers to sell highly targeted advertising opportunities. The really critical thing is for them to get these datapoints from you: your purchasing patterns, your age, gender, race, postal code, etc. They're even willing to provide free services to extract this information to you and me. You may think of Google Search and Google Maps as just one kind of "Freebie", a public facility that we access at no cost whatsoever. It may look this way, but as Srnicek said, it's like a new territory to be colonized. 

## Network Effects
It's constantly in the interests of these companies to get more information on how we use these services. Soforth, and so on. And you'll remember that the critical idea Srnicek unfolds is "Network Effects", to put it simply, the more you use a network, the more others will want to join. Simply, one telephone in the world is useless, if there is 1 telephone, then there is no use, but if there are 2 or 3, metcalfe's law says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected to the system (n2). Since networks are the means by which many platform capitalists extract information from users, there is a very strong inscentive to expand these networks, or give them away for free. This is first mover advantage. The idea of rapid expansion on a network. The more people on a network, the more it's worth. 

The other thing you have to think about to this importance of data, whicih is a saying that is quite known.
> "If you're not paying to the product, then you are the product being sold"

If you are receiving a free service, in a media envornment it is almost certainly because the platform is going to either use or sell information for advertising purpose. All of the information about you is being put into use by the company selling that product. Some platform companies do sell commodities to you, but alot cather information to sell to ad companies.

## Convergence
The second term Srnicek refrences is Convergence. An entry in the same domains which is also competitive. This could be considered to be "Fighting it out" over contested territory. Platforms start from a "core buisness segment", but then start ot expand across other areas of buisness, where they can cull and gather information and it starts to bring them into competition with eachther. They step out of their area, and will contest an area where another oligopolistic tendancies are emerging. Google (android) v. Apple (iPhone), have taken over the operating system that runs on your phone, moving to virtual assistants and increasingly wanting people to buy IoT devices, like the nest, echo and home automation hubs. The contest over crowd computing services to the US government (reading from this week), we discussed the centrality of AWS, using their resources and renting them out to other digital media companies, where they have continued to grow. There are also other platform capitalist companies that are also interested in this are Google and Microsoft. One of the biggest of these is selling to the Pentagon. It reminds us, again the importance of the state in contemporary platform capitalism. You may remember the military origins of the interent, ARPANET originally grew out of experiments by the US government which was going to function in extreme conditions, eliminating fixed command posts to be taken out. 

Many people who write about the internet write as if once Academics and Culturalists got ahold of the internet they broke it free of the military and turned it into this cultural place for leisure. All around the world, as the digital revolution expanded, more and more military operations are dependant on these technology. In past years, cyberwar, etc. have become relevant. This recent clash or context between Amazon and Microsoft over who will get the contract for the Pentagon's "WarCloud", as the JEDI Project, it reminds us that the state and the military security aspects of the states continue to be big customers and work hand in glove with corperations. Increasingly, we have a military digital complex. Just to remind you of the article (video from article).
