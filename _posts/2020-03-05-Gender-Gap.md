After the internmission of the reading week, we will be resuming regular services. The next theme is the Conflict in Platform Capitalism Essay 2. I am not going to repeat again. In general, we will be picking up on the thread of the discussion of Camebridge Analytica, Privacy invasions, etc. And the development of Platform Capitalism and kinds of conflict that are listed there. Your tutorial leaders brought up that you were critical about Platform Capitalism, and looking in conflicts in Platform Capitalism are in fact very far from being negative, but rather realistic. I've pointed out that issues of political economy of media are questions of power and weath, and issues of both wealth and issues of power, who gets who to do the bidding. There are issues where people are in conflict. One would have to be an idiot to not look at conflict in our organization. It's not because we raise these questions of tension or friction that we need to absorb, then relinquish your social media and high-tech communications. I am not dictating to you what side you should favour in these conflicts, but I do want you to understand in a sufficient depth that you can see your own biases around these issues. We are going to take a critical perspective means that we are going to deal with the reality of platform captialsm rather than the fantacy. 

## Google: Platform Capitalism's Big Success?
As an example, I am going to take Google as a case study, one of the bigger success stories of platform capitalism. I'm going to use this study, beginning with a concrete example and next week we will work backwords. I think it's useful to put something in our backpack that we can refer to and say this is the sort of thing that we're talking about. If we choose Google, it's another good look at a major specemen, we've payed attention to both Facebook and Amazon, but Google is a very very important exemplar of Platform Capitalism. It's one of the most attractive examples. All of us in this room, it would be very rare that someone in a University would not use Google. "Google it" has become a catchword of everyday life. It's also a massively successful company, hugely profitable; one of the big 5 tech companies that occupies the ranks of the most highly market valued capitalist corporations in the world. In addition to Google's Search Function, it offers numerous products: ranging from Docs, YouTube, Android based-mobile phones, etc. that Google also produces. Something that is inspiring story of how Google came into being. It's a good example of garage-based invention: Larry Page and Sergei Brin prefected the algorithm by which they based this venture. In the course of this, they have amassed massive capital, and have since retired from leadership roles of itself and its holding company Alphabet. It makes him the 7th richest person in the world, and brin the 10th richest person in the world. Google has been extremely good to them. Something that is also interesting about Google is their corporate motto -- "Don't do evil", where they recognize their corporate social... Idea - taking google's approach to search from those of competitors that mixed in paid ads with search results. They wanted to have a clean search engine. This very very clear moral pronouncement that comes with the vast amount of data coming from using your search engine.

Google is also seemingly a good place to work, located in Mountainview California, perks, conveniences, and high salaries that can come from working as a high tech professional for one of these giant high-tech corporations.

## Google's "Civil War"
There's a mild note of joking caution; is it too good to be true? There is some of that here at Western. Is it surprising that there is a crisis in labour-management crisis, which has been determined Google's Civil War. So, what are the issues in this highly utopian setting that create tension and unhappiness. I'm going to talk about three. The first is a talk about precarious and part time work in issues of ethnicity. The second is military contracting, and what is being produced by that work. The third is the issues in sexism and sexual harassment, which were central in the Google Walkouts of 2019. I'm going to give the most attention to the third issue, but I'm going to give it context of the previous issues. Not only being issues of womens rights but also workers rights. Let's proceed through this. The first issue has to do with what is called precarious work, which usually means insecure, part-time or contract work without the security, or long-term benefits of full time work. I'm going to show a video called "Workers Leaving the Googleplex". In summary, it concerns the way in which Wilson, a temporary worker at Google attempted to document the conditions of other temporary workers that were outside the circle of Google perks and benefits. A sort of second class group of Google workers. You'll understand this as a joke or kind of commentary on a very famous film one of which the first films ever made and projected.

It's called "Exiting the Factory" (1895). Leaving the Googleplex, the conditions around industrial factories haven't gone away from the information age industry. So, I don't know how you received that: it's kind of a point to the story, but he got fired for taking some risks, he documented some Google workers who were not as luxurious as the rest of the Google workers, but tht film was made in 2007. The issue of the precarious part-time temporary workers at Google has not gone away, but has gotten very much bigger, when a piece in the New York Times revealed that slightly over half of 200,000+ Google employees are temporary-contract workers that exist outside of the widely admired top rank positions of the Googleplex. With all the sorts of vulnerabilities, etc. by Wilson's film. Also in 2019, it was announced that Google Temp employees were making a move to unionize that they found their conditions of work so unsatisfactory that they were wanting to join the US Steel Workers union. 

## Project Maven
This is an issue that got bigger. The sad issue that I wanted to deal with, which has boiled the waters around Google is the type of contracts Google has been engaging in; one of which was Project Maven, which Google engaged in with the US Armed Forces. This was a project that improves the image recognition for drones, by which commit air strikes in the war on terror, which have hit innocent people in the past. The core of this project caused 12 google employees to leave.

So, this really occasioned pretty major workplace descent. A number of quite similar software engineers resigned over this, and 3000 people signed a letter protesting a business of war. They say that this vindicated Google as a company that says "don't do evil". 1. Google did not make a promise to say they wouldn't do future contracts... Handed off to Alphabet shell company, the nature of the work Google has been undertaking has continued to ferment in antoher significant case that came up called Project Dragonfly. This was to establish Google in China. It had come up against the censorship requirements. There was alot of discussion around how much Google would submit to China, eventually withdrawing from China. They did have an attempt to re-enter the China market through a Chinese search company. I'm not going to get into the project now, but with this, I am suggesting for you to write your second essay on. In the past few years, we have discovered some of the friction that google takes on in its employees.

## Big Tech Gender

The third, largest and most volitile subject in relation to Google's labour relations is an issue of gender. It's widely acknowledged that Silicon Valley companies that hold big tech have a gender problem. There are examples of Platform Capitalist ventures that some have records in numbers in relations. There is a remarkable degree of disparity between the number of men and women employed, the salaries of men and women in relation to their male counterparts, the speed of which ascend or not ascending through heirchy, the number of women that depart the industry, and as we will come to in a moment the unpleasentries and hazards that women have in big tech (stats left on slide). I will ay also that it is in some day remarcable that women in the origins of the computing industry that there was a moment in which women involved in military inventures. See: Adam Turing. So, at the very origins of the computing industry, one of the remarkable things is from that point on until relatively recently in the 1980's in computing and computing science, women were following the same paths of ascent in relative parity with men. That win which we see in other professions. (metrics from US Universities). What you can see there is rather astoundingly they continue to ascend, but for women in computing science rises at first, then very sharply declined from the eighties on happened in one of the highest demand industries. There appears to be a male dominated software engineer programmers, bro culture.  ommitted some slides from the deck that I sent out to you. What are some of the reasons for this strange configuration of gender in big tech?

## Diversity in Tech Gender
So, you think that it's a sign of an industry that develops a toxic, anti-woman culture and that gradually discouraged entry... less women more men.

- Alleged "innate" cognitive differences between men and women
- Popular Culture
- School Problems
- Industry Structure
- Predatory Sexism (sexual harassment)

The question of Innate Differences, where an aligned thought that gender differences have to do with aptitudes for sciences and maths, the STEM discipline in which women are less confident than them. I think they are highly dubious, but they are Definitely in plat and have become flashpoints, particularly in Google. In one famous case, Google Software Engineer circulated his own memo about Google's diversity policies. This was a super-sensitive issue, because Google was already under investigation by the US government about compensation for female employees. Google was very sensitized to this issue and fired Damore filed a series of counter-claims alleging Google's discrimination of conservitive white men. He lost this lawsuit because his grounds couldn't be based in free speech on a discriminatory nature. For any of you looking for significant issues in workplace harassment would be worth writing a paper on. It would be a primer on how it's swirling through Google and other tech companies. 

The other four reasons. 

### Popular Culture: Video Games
The first of these points, which was touched on in contributions from earlier was in coding as masculine. At its core is the video game industry. It's abrupt decline in the 90's was the consumer-oriented video game industry. Because that industry made the assumption would be most attractive to boys and young men; and because of how it was marketed in that way. Classical male thematics established an important gender barrier in gaming, which was emerging as an increasingly important cultural industry. Messing around with early gaming systems, gaining a curiocity in how gaming worked: men and boys got a hands-on practice apprenticeship in this. 

## School
There is a great deal of discussion in which aspects to programming, and tech in general are interesting to young girls. Interest declines during school, seems to relate to lack of role models, lack of feedback mechanism, but also issues raised about teaching styles that discourage collaboration and practical learning.
