###### Prof. Nick Dyer-Witheford
This has been ported from Nick Dyer-Witheford's Lecture Slides.

A bugsplat is has several meanings, it could be the hitting into a windshield by a car, unexpected computer errors, or civilian deaths in drone attacks. Here, we will be using it in the context of problems from platform capitalism.

Mosco uses the term in a similar way, he talks about problems in platform capitalism that we have already talked about, such as their commercialization and concentration (ogolopistic tendencies), or in cyberwar: the several extensions of the military internet. We have also talked about mobile surveillance in the context of Camebridge Analytica. We have also talked about jobs in the gig economy. Mosco's chapter is a central dialect of the themes in the course.

However, today we will look at 2 issues, the environmental impacts of the digital economy. We will also be looking at urban planning and smart cities, which raise questions about surveillance and privacy. Both become hotspots about the ownership, control and use of digital technologies. 

In regard to the environmental pictures of environmental aspects of platform capitalism, they're difficult to assess. The internet of things, big data, etc. may ease the crises of big data, but it could instead be worse. This could be a wild card in global warming.

| Ease Eco-crises  | Aggrivate Eco-crisis  | 
|:-----------------|:----------------------|
|Historical hope to replace physical commodities with virtual ones | Use of ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) involves carbon emissions because data centres for cloud computing have high energy demands for cooling servers.|
| Reduce transportation with communication | Production of ICTs uses energy for manufacture and mining of raw materials | 
| Smart homes, cities allow better monitoring of energy use, therefore better savings | Smart phones particularly bad because phone plans encourage frequent replacements| 
|Paradox that comprehensive digital energy and carbon emission involves the use of ICTs, which in turn use energy.|

As far as global warming goes, big tech's future carbon emissions depend on the energy expanded in making, using and disposing of computing tech. In this, the source must be either renewable or carbon building. At the moment, digital tech produces relatively low carbon emissions, but could change if heavy computing applications, like AI or Netflix at a global scale could be a planet fryer.

Eco-crisis is a broad social issue, but it leads right back to the work and workers. Amazon is a notoriously high-energy company. We have already heard about the uprisings at Google due to military contracting and sexual harassment in the workplace, but the same thing has been happening at Amazon. In 2019, groups of workers rose against the company because of its environmental impacts. Think of all those prime delivery trucks, or energy-consuming datacenters that AWS hosts. Cloud computing assist oil and gas companies, or other high carbon producing industries.

In response to these protests, Bezos promised to address the issues, but to some amazon workers, like those that joined Greta Thunberg inspired global climate strikers, that doesn't seem fast enough. Bezos soon realized that he was under pressure, and promised to donate $10 billion to the Bezos Earth Fund for green projects. This suggests that decarbonization would end tax-evasion practices, which would help fund climate emergency policies.

The second issue wwe will examine is also about the environemtn, but rather smart cities that have been transformed by big tech industries. One of these places that emerged from this issue was San Francisco, close to Silicon Valley, where house prises and rent has risen sharply because of demand from high-wage workers. In 2013, Google Busses became a target of blockades because of the special privileges given to the busses that transport the elite programmers and software engineers. These protests still happen.

A more recent example is the 2018 resistance to Amazon's setting up in Long Island. Cortez was a face of this protest. Amazon decided to come to New York, despite the tax breaks they were once promised being removed from the deal due to the protests.

Article: ["Ocasio-Cortez takes on the Amazon fight in New York" Dana Rubinstein, Poliico 22 Nov. 2018](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/22/amazon-hq-2-new-york-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-1012546)

A much more local, Canadian example of smart cities, like Google which wants to build a city of the future on the waterfront zone, where it promised a zone of urban innovation. Sidewalk's Quayside project drew criticism, ranging from privacy issues to housing activists and tech entrepreneurs. There were concerns about the secrecy and lack of public consultation in the negotiations between the City of Toronto and Sidewalk, about how the US company would own the data extracted from a privitized corporate city within a prime toronto location. Above all, issues of citizen surveillance, data extraction and ownership were prominent.

The following videos demonstrate how platform capitalism's plans ofr urban design ran into unexpected trouble: bugsplat indeed. Sidewalk has since scaled back the plans considerably. Issues about governance and ownership of data gatherd by the cities digital tech apparatus are still unclear, but are likely to come back again someday.

Next week, we will return to looking at the difficulties in public oversight and regulation of big tech companies has become.

Ok, let's call it a day. Apologies if it has been a bit clunky in parts. I hope you can make use of the text resources made available (on the slides) to get a sense of the size of influence that platform capitalism hold on both the natural and urban environment and some of the many issues that it raises. 

Essay is still due the 26th. 

Stay tuned to OWL for announcements, and hope everyone is keeping well.

Best.
