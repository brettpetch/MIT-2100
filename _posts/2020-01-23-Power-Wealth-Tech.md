## Recap: 
Last week we looked at the emergence of technology, in relation to platform capitalism and the changes in the internet. I tried to give a thumbnail sketch in how the intense interest in new forms of digital buisness started to present itself in the 1990's and early 2000's. It really affected the economies since the 1970's. Digital buisness was seen as a neo-liberal agenda for revitalizing the economy. I then pointed out how the economic changes resulted in the internet. With a number of ups and downs, integrating buying / selling on the internet. When this failed in the 2000's, lessons learned from those failures spurred some of the surviving players and new buisnesses drove Web 2.0; which had a more participatory design for engaging in conversation and communities while making money from it. Today, I'd like to talk about how this buisness model is dependant on three technologies: The Cloud, IoT, and Big Data.

## Three Technologies

### Cloud Computing

The remarkably rapid decrease in cost of computing and accessibility to devices and the amount of computing power used by NASA in the early space program is at your fingertips (smartphones). One of the important developments is Cloud Computing, the very simple idea is that when you send an email, use an app or play a game using a digital device, it is quite likely that a large part of the processing is not happening on the device you're using. The new heightened speeds of connectivity have made it possible for computing and storage of data to be conducted far away using "the cloud". So what is this Cloud? While it sounds like air, it is really heavy. It looks like ugly buildings (as seen on slide) and occours in cool, secure earthquake proof data centres. 

#### Data Centers
Huge info sotrage centres host tens of thousands of servers. They are often in remote, cool, stable locations. The companies that own these buildings, which are often members of the Big Tech 5 will store and conduct processes for other buisnesses and corperations. More like a data factory than a data locker. Little of what you are doing is likely happening somewhere like Nebraska, Alaska, etc. 

## Internet of Things
An increasing number of material every-day objects are themselves computerized and contain digital sensors. Many computers which are capable of monitoring their own operations, such as a smart refridgerator, thermostat, etc. Is almost certainly sending data to a corperate vendor. This means that we are moving through the life, using apps such as Fitness Applicaitons, etc. to meausure your daily runs, different levels of excertion, stress etc. have the capacity to make calculation about what you're doing as well as relay it to a network of datacentres. It's not just factories, prime examples of the IoT are amazon echo, using radio services (like spotify), etc. This leads into the idea of having microchipped bodies. 

### How Human is the Internet?
- More traffic is generated by bots than humans (2017 Internet Trends Report)
- In 2020 there will be 26x conected things than people (IDC)
- In 5 years, smartphones, desktops and tablets outnumbered by computers in "smart" homes, offices, cities and cars (Cisco)

## Big Data
Could be talking about a specific event, whether it be the tragedy that was the Iranian Airlines flight a few days ago. Highly automated cars providing information about speed, braking, etc. or it could be about people. We are constantly spilling off from our devices whether we know it or not. 
- Big Data = Increasing amounts of information available from digital technology
- Social media and mobile phones
- About events, sstems, people
- Becoming available in ever-greater volime, velocity, and variety.

### Big Data and Analytics
The term algorithm, which sounds complicated is really just the application of procedural instructions that can be set to data. Just like a recipe or formula for processing information. That may make it seem not immediately exciting, it amounts to Data Mining. Data mining is the discovering patterns, trends or preferences that are revealed by sorting the data. For those of you interested in buisness, advertising will know how fundamental this has become for the targeting of advertisments. On it rests more precise things. If you can actively look at active streams of data, you can discover that from classic data mining case was the discovery made by Walmart when they put together records of purchases. They discovered that men that bought diapers on friday evening were likely to buy beer. 
This told walmart that it would be a good idea to draw people's attention to beer on a friday night.
