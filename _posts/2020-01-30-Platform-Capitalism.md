## Notes
While your tutorial leaders have said you are a sociable bunch, they do notice that readings have not been done. Is there anything troubling or concerning you? I will talk about the midterm on the 13th, the least class before reading week.

# Today:
We are going to complete the video essay on how technologies have been influencial in the success of Amazon. After that tour, we're going to explore the crucial topic this class addresses. Platform Capitalism. Through this, the author of our text will talk about Platform Capitalism.

# Cloud, Data, Things
You'll remember that the technologies we were suggesting as being really critical in big tech today were IoT, the cloud and Big Data. In the case of Amazon, we see all of these things at play, but some of them more prevelant than others: Web PAge (analytics), Warehouse (IoT), Delivery (IoT), Smart Home (IoT), Data Centres (Cloud). The delivery systems Amazon has and the way in which integrating IoT lead to some speedy yet strange delivery systems. Anticipatory shipping, where they can dispatch goods before an order is placed. To give you one (or 3 rather) more IoT Examples, in how smart home technologies: the habitually resorted to devices inside of our home. We are then going to look at the Amazon DataCentres. After we looked at the smart home and how we talk about them, we can look at the ways that Amazon is providing small digitized devices. In various ways, it's convenient for you, but also enables the intensification of demand for goods. Three examples: [Dash](https://tinyurl.com/y6xhd4m7), [Alexa](https://time.com/5568815), [Ring](https://tinyurl.com/yyz8apxb), [Ring again](https://tinyurl.com/y4dxepnm), and [finally ring](https://tinyurl.com/y3ofbrsp). I invite you to note the somewhat distasteful and all too stereotypical video.


This is how the commodification of our everyday environment. These clips do not constitute a deep analytic portrayed of the image displayed. What I want to demonstrate to you is: This is what the internet of things looks like, and this is how they're starting to pervade our everyday lives and how it makes sense in a commercial logic. This brings us to the third and final segment. This one isn't so obvious. The enormous role that is played by the Amazon Data Centres (AWS), which employs a worldwide network that enables data storage to everyone. [This Clip](https://youtu.be/mxCfygY1dk8) shows us what AWS is. 

For the purposes of exhibiting them, I have broken down and analyzed them. You must realize, however that you need to realize they are working ensemble. As this whole process of warehousing and dispatching, it's making use of Big Data. Prehaps you have a smar thome device, the data is generated, they're being subjected to amazon datacentres, then informs it of more reccomendations, etc.

The result of this is the World's Richest Man: Jeff Bezos

This raises a certain number of concerns about where the top 1% of the top 1% are in relation to everyone else. The point that Mosco makes is that cloud computing, IoT and big data analytics is the asshole (or armory) of big tech. All of the large tech companies are doing large operations with high interest in data analytics, cloud computing. In the future, I am going to talk about the chinese sector of big data, etc.

In the readings for this week, I did put an article on Facebook, I'd like you to read and put it in your mental storage locker. Let me pause here: Are there any questions about the Amazon Discussion?

> None.

# Platform Capitalism
Now, we are going to go into the main item. A real intensive breakdown of what is Platform Capitalism and what does it mean.

Mosco really brings it in on the Big Tech Five, all using the most recent technology available. They have many tenticles of interest in their corperate structure. Each of the Big Tech Five has at least one commanding feature of division. We'll talk about these structures in specifics later. The point I want to highlight now is that all of these big tech companies are part of the buisness model Platform Capitalism. PC is not only the Big Tech Five, but also smaller companies, such as Twitter or Uber. The BTF have exemplorary lobbying power, and are all examples of Platform Capitalism.

## Platforms
First, I'd like to go through what a platform is. There can be all kinds of meanings to this. One may be the raised horizontal flat surface, a declaration of principles and policies,  the use of platform that is typically associated with political parties. The third an oil platform, like a drilling rigs. Then there are platform shoes, and the vehicle (like a satellite or aircraft) used to carry a specific kind of equipment (like in war). All of these are possible uses for the term platform, those who enjoy playing with words, we can look at how these definitions are related. The particular use of the world we are going to look at (in platform capitalism) is the computer design and equipment using in a specific digital system. We may look at the much larger systems, like how if we talk about Amazon's platform as the array of digital technologies we just discussed. To talk about platform capitalism, I could have of course lectured you at some length about the topic, but I'd rather let the author of the book tell you about it. The lecture and the book came out since 2017. Since about 4 years have passed since the lecture has been given, we have passed some points of his which we may or may not agree with. I will stop the video at points like that just to make a few comments. I think for the most part that this is a clear account of what Platform Capitalism is.

Play to just after intro, then skip to ~7 mins in.

I wanted to play the first few minutes to talk about the essay assignment, and how it refers to the commercial logic of platform capitalism. Nick Srnicek answers it. He's looking at the certain platforms, not at certain cultural values, not as examples of organizations that can be morally pursuaded to work within ethics; but rather as profit making buisnesses in how they have incentives to work in certain ways. In your essay, where I ask you to situate your use of platforms (i am asking you to identify how you are a part of the economic system of platform capitalism) and how you are put to work within that structure of contraints and the nature of a platform nature. Srnicek continues to talk about how we shouldn't think of platform capitalism as how it can't just be confined to the computer industry, or a sharing economy. It isn't a sharing economy, because you don't charge your friends for a slice. He splits it out from other terms. 

The Fordist model: the mass production, the mass consumption. Also under post-fordist model. Just intime, changing consumer demand, etc. moving away from mass production to "what would you like in your car?"

Platform capitalism brings together what is a multi-sided market. Essentially, Facebook is an intermediary between the users and the advertising. Uber is an infastructure for drivers, people that need rides, also advertsing. On top of this, building apps, software, etc. all provides infastructure, then allowing people to develop on top of it. What is interesting about this is that we exclude one company (Apple), and regard it as a luxury goods company. 

Nick disagrees with this: Apple's profit is not in just iPhones and technology items. I think he plays down the App Store, as the App Store is part of what made the iPhone so popular. You can download all of these apps onto the platform of the iPhone that propels Apple's software. He also doesn't realize that Apple Music, App Store sales, etc. You can write about Apple as a platform capitalist. 

In a few characteristics of platforms is a network effect: the more people that use a platform, the more people join it, the more people are likely to join it. This leads to monopolies. Google is the monopoly on search, Facebook in social networking. 

The second characteristic is platform cross-subsidation: Google will provide you email, but it will sell for ads.  Balanced out to get more users on board to create a network and build a monopoly.

Platforms have a designed core architecture. It is important for us to research how... Uber shows there is more supply than there actually has. It also uses SURGE PRICING, where it suggests that there is more people in one area, raising prices. Relating to this, it's related to the politics of the platform.
As intermediaries and infasctructures are positioned to caputre and control as much data as possible, Platforms are the ideal way to extract data.

### Types of Platforms:
1. Advertising
2. Cloud / Industrial
3. Product
4. Lean

``` pause ```
We're now going into the specific commercial logic of how a platform operates. You will need this in your essay. Where does the Platform place itself in the taxonomy stream of what it is that a platform is interested in YOU for. How you fit into its work.

Any given company can participate in a number of these. Amazon relies on all 4. Google also participates in each of these at once. For google, 89% of revenue comes from advertising. Facebook gets 98% ad revenue. The idea is that they extract data from users, work on that data. 

They don't sell data directly, instead they use data to match people with advertisers. They have to be pushing the edges of privacy all of the time to advertise efficiently.

**Cloud Platforms:**
Salesforce, AWS: Provide hardware, tools, etc. to various platforms. Uber owns very little in assets: rents servers, etc. They are a 'lean platform'. Cloud platforms are a huge part of the platform economy. Google has various ML algorithms you can rent. MS creates AI that can be rented, IBM working on Quantum Cloud. Amazon is much more of a cloud platform than ever before.

**Industrial Platform:**
The ida of connecting sensors to the internet. The industrial internet of things would be connected to an intranet. It will increase productivity, improve maintenance, etc. BASF: Smart Factory - every bottle is different than the one before it. That's interesting and all, but the platform providers of the industrial internet. GE & Segmond's: app store for companies. This is where the real money is in the internet. Both companies are trying to get... GE's cloud based system collects more data than Facebook. Going to be worth .... billion dollars in 2020. The money is here with GE and Segmonds with their industrial playforms.

**Product Platform:**
Goods and services that can be rented. Companies trying to recouperate Free informational goods. The music industry has been going down. In 2016, platforms are incorperating free goods into recouperating free aspects of the contemporary economy. Rolls Royce: creation of jet engines. Shifted from jet engines to renting thrust. Charging airlines by the mile by how much thrust is used. They get maintenance, rolls gets data. Rolls Royce is at the leading edge of jet engine production. Now, the final one I'm going to talk about...

**Lean Platforms:**
Uber, the world's largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. AirBNB owns no hotels. They are not profitable. They basically just own the minimal platform. Their profitability is the outsourcng of costs. Not only does Uber have to pay for maintenance, etc. they profit through VC wellfare. The immense amount of money being thrown at a platform. VC in Silicon Valley is the only thing keeping them afloat. Most of these companies are not profitable. Uber is arguably profitability, but to fight off competitors in China, it's losing $1 millon/yr.

2020 Update: Uber is still losing money, it's own projections that it will turn a profit in 2021, but if you look at the buisness press, there is a large amount of confusion around when the company will actually become profitable. 

These services cannot survive within a capitalist economy. Each of the platforms get revenue from a different source, etc. Three possible futures: monopoly platforms -- Winner takes all model. The necessity of data extraction to these companies: why Google turned into Alphabet -- expanding into places they can get more data. The likely future is that we will see closed, expansive and monopolistic platforms. They will buy out and monopolize. To condsider: the very large monopoly tending capitalist companies to buy up other platforms has intensified. You may find that the platform you want to write about, a buisness that runs on a platform basis is part of a larger platform capitalist.

#### Twitch
Classic example of platform has been bought up by Amazon. or LinkedIn being bought by Microsoft. in the growth in huge monopoly platform capitalists. in the 2nd part of the course, I think this has changed. Due to social rebellions, etc. there is at least now, some resistance to the growing type of power in this buisness model. There is much up in the air in this buisness model. 

Any Questions you may have about points arising from Srenck's...
